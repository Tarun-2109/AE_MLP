# Autoencoders and Multi-Layer Perceptron: Feature Extraction and Classification

This approach can greatly improve classification performance by taking advantage of the strengths of both models. By leveraging learned compressed representations we have achieved the improved performance while reducing the computational complexity. The tutorial also includes performance metrics such as accuracy and loss, as well as visualizations of the training process and a confusion matrix to evaluate the classification results.
